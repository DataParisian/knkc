/* KNKC chapter 13 exercise 7
 * Sundeep Kolli 17-apr-2014
 * Program: ex7.c
 * Purpose: Suppose that str is an array of characters. Which one of the 
 * following statements is not equivalent to the other three:
*/

/*
 *  a) *str = 0;
 *  b) str[0] = '\0';
 *	c) strcpy(str, "");
 *  d) strcat(str, "");
 
 *  Ans)  a) is not equivalent to the other three because a) is setting the 
 *  first element of the array str to an integer value i.e., 0 whereas the 
 *  other 3 statements are setting str to be an empty string.
