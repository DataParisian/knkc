 * Program: ex2.c
 * Purpose: Suppose that p has been declared as follows:
 *			char *p = "abc";
 *          Which of the following calls are legal? Show the output of each
 *          legal call and explain why others are illegal?

	*     	   pointer to a string. Produces compiler/error and undefined
