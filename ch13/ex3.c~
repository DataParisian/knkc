/* KNKC chapter 13 exercise 4
 * Sundeep Kolli 16-apr-2014
 * Program: ex4.c
 * Purpose: Modify the read_line function in the following ways:
 *	a) Have it skip white space before storing input characters.
 *  b) Have it stop reading at the first white space character. Hint: To 
 *	   determine whether or not a character is a white space, call isspace 
 *     function.
 *  c) Have it stop reading at the first new-line character, then store the 
 *     new-line character in the string.
 *  d) Have it leave behind characters that it deosn't have room to store.
