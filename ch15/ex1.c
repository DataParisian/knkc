 * Program: ex1.c
 * Purpose: Section 15.1 described several advantages of dividing a program 
 * into multiple source files. Answer the following questions.
*/

/*
a) Describe several other advantages.
Ans: When programs get large, splitting into multiple files would make it 
     easier to follow itslogical structure. Each file would be a separate unit.
	 
	 Program recompiling time would be reduced hugely since only the file 
	 that has been modified would be recompiled.
	 
	 Code reuse and sharing would increase.
	 
	 People can work on separate files in parallel.

b) Describe some disadvantages.
Ans: The disadvantages mostly apply to smaller programs. In case of a simple 
	 program, dividing the program into multiple files can be too much of a 
	 hassle compared to the benefits.
	 
	 Dependencies could be tricky to follow and maintain.
