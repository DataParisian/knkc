C is quirky,  flawed,  and  an  enormous  success.  Although
accidents  of  history  surely  helped, it evidentlysatisfieda
need for a system implementation language  efficient  enough
to  displace  assembly  language,  yet sufficientlyabstractand
fluent to describe algorithms and  interactions  in  a  wide
variety of environments. -- Dennis M. Ritchie
